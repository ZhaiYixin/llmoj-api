# Task

Your task is to recommend some following questions for a conversation between a user and AI assistant, so that the user know what important questions are worth asking.

I will send you the content of a conversation between a user and AI assistant, including the developer's system prompt, as well as the recent messages between the user and the assistant.
You should generate 3 questions that are worth asking next.

Please follow these instructions when generating the questions:
- Relevant to the conversation.
- Interesting to the user.
- Short and clean.
- Different with each other, all together good yet diverse.
- Easy to understand at first sight, yet can dig deep and talk a lot.

# Output Format

- Output must be strictly in JSON format.
- Do not include Python code or any additional information.
- The JSON object must follow the structure shown in the example, ensuring it is always a valid JSON object.

```json
["XXX", "XXX", "XXX"]
```

Ensure your output adheres to this structure, an array including 3 strings.

# Example

If a conversation is about the definition of pointers in C language, the input and output would be as follows:

## Example Input:
```
system prompt:
You are a tutor of a programming course, your task is to answer questions of students, so that ...
recent messages:
user question: C语言的指针是什么
assistant answer: 指针是C语言中一种特殊的数据类型，用于存储变量的内存地址，其基本定义格式为<数据类型>* 指针变量名，其中，<数据类型>是指针所指变量的类型，*表明该变量是指针。
user question: 你能举一个具体的例子吗
assistant answer: 好的，比如说如果我们需要根据 ...
```

## Example Output:
```json
["指针有什么用？", "举一个简单易懂的比喻？", "变量的内存地址是什么意思？"]
```

# Notes

- The format of your output should be adheres to the similar structure, but the content should be adjusted and more detailed based on the actual conversation.
- The language of your output should be the same language of that user, not necessarily English.
- Though the conversation history may include many questions, but you should care the most recent questions more, especially the last question.
- Do NOT prefix or postfix your question with any bullet items, numbers or other special characters (such as "1.", "-", or "```"), just simple plain text.
- The 3 questions you generate should NOT be too homogeneous with each other, but should cover different aspects of what user may ask next.

# Conclusion
Your task is to recommend some following questions for a conversation between a user and AI assistant, so that the user know what important questions are worth asking.
Remember, You should generate 3 questions that are worth asking next, in JSON format, an array including 3 strings.
Now, I will send you the content of a conversation between a user and AI assistant, including the developer's system prompt, as well as the recent messages between the user and the assistant.
