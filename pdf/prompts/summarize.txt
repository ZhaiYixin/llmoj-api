# Task
Your task is to summarize the outline of PowerPoint (PPT) content, to enhance readers' understanding.

I will send you the text of all pages of the PPT.
You need to segment the PPT into smaller sections.
For each sections, you need to conclude a title and a description.
You also need to label the start page and end page of the section.
You also need to write some questions that cover the key points of the section.

# Guidelines
Please follow these instructions for each section of the PPT:
- Provide a succinct title for the section.
- Encapsulate the section in a simple description.
- Indicate the starting and ending pages exactly.
- Write some questions that arouse the curiosity of readers.

The number of sections should be moderate, neither too few nor too many.
If a section contains too many pages, you should split it into several smaller sections.

# Output Format

- Output must be strictly in JSON format.
- Do not include Python code or any additional information.
- The JSON object must follow the structure shown in the example, ensuring it is always a valid JSON object.

```json
[
  {
    "title": "title of the section",
    "description": "description of the section",
    "start_page": the starting page number of the section,
    "end_page": the ending page number of the section,
    "questions": ["question1", "question2", "question3"]
  }
]
```

Ensure each section adheres to the same structure, including a `title` (string), a `description` (string), a `start_page` (number), a `end_page` (number), and some `questions` (an array of strings).
Such a structure can be named as a `section`, and your final output is an array of sections.

# Example

If a section of the PPT is about the definition of pointers in C language, the input and output would be as follows:

## Example Input:
```
<PPT>
  <page number="1">C语言中的指针是...</page>
  <page number="2">其基本定义格式为...</page>
  <page number="3">...</page>
  <page number="4">...</page>
  <page number="5">...</page>
</PPT>
```

## Example Output:
```json
[
  {
    "title": "指针的定义",
    "description": "指针是C语言中一种特殊的数据类型，用于存储变量的内存地址，其基本定义格式为<数据类型>* 指针变量名，其中，<数据类型>是指针所指变量的类型，*表明该变量是指针。",
    "start_page": 1,
    "end_page": 2,
    "questions": ["指针是什么？", "指针怎么用？", "为什么要有指针？"]
  }
]
```
(Note: Real examples should be adjusted and more detailed based on the actual PPT content.)

# Notes
- Even if there is only one section, wrap the JSON object in brackets [] to allow for parsing as an array.
- If a page of the PPT contains disordered text, it is due to imperfect text extraction. Try to infer the intended meaning of the text.
- If a page of the PPT is empty, it may be a title page for the following pages, or a graph illustrating the topic of the previous pages. Make an educated guess based on its location in the PPT.

# Conclusion
Your task is to summarize the outline of PowerPoint (PPT) content.
I will input all pages of the PPT, and you need to output an array of sections.
