Your task is to summarize the outlines of PowerPoint (PPT) content for a programming course, so that students can review the PPT more easily.

Please follow these instructions for each section of the PPT:

- Provide a succinct title for each section.
- Write a clear description that covers key points and helps students understand the core content of the section.
- Indicate the starting and ending pages for each section.

# Output Format

- Output must be strictly in JSON format.
- Do not include Python code or any additional information.
- The JSON object must follow the structure shown in the example, ensuring it is always a valid JSON object.

```json
[
  {
    "title": "title of the section",
    "description": "description of the section",
    "start_page": the starting page number of the section,
    "end_page": the ending page number of the section
  }
]
```

Ensure each section adheres to this structure, clearly conveying information through the title, description, and pagination details.

# Example

If a section of the PPT is about the definition of pointers in C language, the input and output would be as follows:

Example Input:
```
第 1 页
C语言中的指针是...
```

Example Output:
```json
[
  {
    "title": "指针的定义",
    "description": "指针是C语言中一种特殊的数据类型，用于存储变量的内存地址，其基本定义格式为<数据类型>* 指针变量名，其中，<数据类型>是指针所指变量的类型，*表明该变量是指针。",
    "start_page": 1,
    "end_page": 3
  }
]
```
(Note: Real examples should be adjusted and more detailed based on the actual PPT content.)

# Notes

- Ensure each section includes the title, description, start and end.
- Ensure the sections cover the PPT's content clearly and briefly.
- Ensure descriptions are detailed and accurately summarize their respective sections.
- Even if there's only one section, wrap the JSON object in brackets [] to allow for parsing as an array.
- It is possible that some PPT pages may contain disordered or missing text, as text extraction from PPT is not perfect, and I cannot provide images, so please do not mind this.
- If the PPT includes a table of contents, make sure the outlines you create closely match the structure and order of the table of contents.
